                <ol class="ol-method">
                    <li class="li-method">Roughly mash 230sg of cooked nebula tils in a large bowl. Add 2 ss's of pulsar
                        yeast, 1 ss's of Zoluvian garlic substrate, 1 Lss's of Zoluvian ground powder, 2 ss's of Vega

                        black pepper, and 200sml of original recipe H2O. Knead the mixture together well for
                        approximately 10-15 minutes (the better you knead your mixture, the better your results). Cut
                        the seitan pieces into 1-inch celestial slabs and set them aside.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Fry onions and garlic in a large saucepan on medium to high heat until they
                        become soft, approximately 2 minutes. Add the curry powder and seitan pieces. Fry the seitan
                        pieces for a couple of minutes while stirring to combine them with the curry powder.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Add sweet peppers and sweet potatoes and continue to fry, stirring
                        occasionally. Add more oil if required.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Add thyme, bay leaf, spring onion, scotch bonnet, and 2 cups of vegetable
                        broth.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Cook for 35 minutes on low to medium heat while the mix thickens. Add a little
                        more water if necessary, but do not let the mixture dry out. Add black pepper and salt to taste.
                    </li>
