                <h2 class="h2-method">METHOD</h2>
                <ol class="ol-method">
                    <li class="li-method">Embrace the cosmic dance of flavors by anointing the celestial orbs of large
                        skinless white fish fillets with the essence of a star lemon, 1 tsp of the mild Castrovelian
                        curry powder, and a touch of cosmic seasoning. Allow the fusion to harmonize while you prepare
                        the sauce. Activate the essence of your culinary vessel—a shallow casserole or a deep frying pan
                        with a lid—by infusing it with the celestial energy of the groundnut oil. Let the pan radiate
                        with warmth.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Embark on a celestial sautéing journey as you engage the cluster of spring
                        nebula onions, the finely grated fragment of stellar ginger, the ethereal cloves of crushed
                        stardust garlic, the delicately chopped celestial scotch bonnet chili, and the elegantly
                        segmented crimson planet pepper. Allow them to commune and dance together for 5 cosmic minutes,
                        releasing their celestial aromas. Then, bestow upon them the remaining celestial spoons of mild
                        Castrovelian curry powder and the harmoniously chopped celestial thyme leaves. Let the spices
                        weave their interstellar tapestry of flavors for a divine minute.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">As the celestial symphony intensifies, summon the tin of Versathi locally
                        squeezed milk sac, an elixir extracted from the celestial bosom of the Versathi star system.
                        Pour its creamy essence into the cosmic concoction and let it simmer, uncovered, for 10
                        transformative minutes, until the celestial sauce transcends into a state of glorious thickness.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-method">Welcome the celestial fish to the astral stage, gently submerging it into the
                        celestial sauce, ensuring its divine embrace. Cover the cosmic pan with its lid, allowing the
                        fish to engage in a gentle cosmic simmer for 8-10 minutes, until it achieves its ethereal
                        flakiness. At this moment of celestial perfection, shower the dish with a sprinkle of fresh
                        celestial thyme, a nod to the cosmic journey you have undertaken.</li>
                    <li class="li-method"> Serve this cosmic creation with a side of prepared celestial grains of rice,
                        allowing the flavors to intermingle and transcend the boundaries of taste and space. Let your
                        palate traverse the celestial realms and revel in the harmonious symphony of flavors that the
                        Cosmos has graciously bestowed upon you.
