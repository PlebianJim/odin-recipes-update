                <p class="p-description">Originating from the tropical paradise of a distant star system, this ethereal
                    creation draws inspiration from the renowned Akatonian delicacy known as "Akatonian sal pi", I have
                    summoned the cosmic forces to recreate this stellar feast,
                    transforming it into an interstellar sensation for all spacefaring epicureans.

                    Instead of venturing into the uncharted wilderness of fresh celestial pi, I have harnessed the
                    convenience of canned celestial pi, making this intergalactic epicurean adventure accessible to
                    all cosmic voyagers. Fear not, for the celestial flavors remain intact, providing a taste experience
                    as delectable as if we were utilizing fresh celestial pi plucked from the alien shores of distant
                    planets.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-method">METHOD</h2>
                <ol class="ol-method">
                    <li class="li-method">Immerse the salty celestial fish in a bowl of frigid cosmic water and allow it
                        to soak for a minimum of two cosmic hours. Drain the cosmic water from the bowl.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">In a celestial saucepan, place the soaked salty celestial fish and cover it
                        with fresh cosmic water. Set the pan over medium cosmic heat and allow it to boil for
                        approximately 15 celestial minutes.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Remove the pan from the cosmic heat source and discard the hot cosmic water.
                        Rinse the fish in cold cosmic water to cool it down.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Remove the skin from the fish and delicately remove the celestial bones,
                        preparing the salt celestial fish in flaky form. Set it aside for a cosmic moment.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Over medium celestial fire, warm the cosmic cooking oil in a stellar cooking
                        skillet. Add the astral onions, celestial thyme, stellar tomatoes, sweet stellar bell peppers,
                        cosmic scotch bonnet pepper, and chopped stellar scallions. Sauté these celestial ingredients
                        together for a harmonious cosmic dance, lasting approximately 3 cosmic minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-method">Introduce the flaked salt celestial fish to the celestial skillet and continue
                        cooking for an additional 3 cosmic minutes.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Gently add the canned celestial ackee to the stellar concoction, reducing the
                        heat to a lower cosmic setting. Allow the celestial mixture to simmer, blending the flavors
                        together for a celestial duration of 10-15 cosmic minutes.</li>
                    <li class="li-method">Sprinkle the cosmic black pepper into the cosmic skillet, harnessing its
                        otherworldly essence. Then, with a graceful cosmic gesture, deactivate the heat source and
                        prepare to serve.</li>
